Limit Subheadings: Avoid using too many levels of subheadings. Too many levels can make the document look cluttered and difficult to follow.

9. Test for Usability
Reader Feedback: If possible, get feedback from potential readers to ensure that headings and subheadings are clear and useful. This can help identify any areas that may need adjustment.
Accessibility Check: Ensure that headings are accessible to all users, including those using screen readers. Properly tagged headings in HTML or other formats can improve accessibility.

10. Incorporate Visual Elements
Bulleted Lists: Use bulleted or numbered lists under subheadings to organize detailed information effectively.
Highlighting: Use visual elements like color or icons sparingly to emphasize important headings, but ensure they do not distract from the content.
